I'm a software engineer, MMA geek, movie nerd, and winner of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering a new form of quantum fluid with fractionally-charged excitations.

One of these things _may_ be a lie.

In the past, I've worked for large-scale managed services providers, SaaS and data management services, and healthcare technology companies. I've developed third-party integrations with (and for) services you've almost definitely used (or, at least, heard of). Outside of that, I spend my personal time ostensibly trying to address various problems with software solutions. In practice, I create problems and make them slightly-smaller problems with more code than necessary.
